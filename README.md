# Cryptocurrencies
Use unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrencies

## Objectives:
A. Preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA 
B. Reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.
C. K-means algorithm is used to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data:
  An elbow curve is created 
  Predictions are made on the K clusters of the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data
  A new DataFrame is created with the same index as the crypto_df 
  Create scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot
